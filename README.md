# Dentist Office API

This project was developed as a technical challenge, the only goal here is to show my knowledge and of course to have
some fun while doing it. < Ã‰rica is a ficticional dentist! > <br>
This API was developed to feed the front end APP [Dentist Office APP](https://github.com/VitorCorrea18/softeo-frontend)

  ## Running DB locally
  
  In the project's folder install the dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  
  Create a **.env** file in the app's root directory with the variables for your MySQL server connection. EX:
  ```bash
  DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASSWORD=123456
  DB_PORT=3002
  ```
  Start the application with
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  It will automatically create the DB, tables and also insert some data to test the API.

  ## Docker
  
  Run the docker-compose script at the projects root folder
  ```bash
